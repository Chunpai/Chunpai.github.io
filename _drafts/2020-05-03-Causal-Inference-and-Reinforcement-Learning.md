## Structure Equation Model



## Counterfactual Analysis  

The counterfactual question for reinforcement learning is "how will the system perform if, when the data was collected, we had replaced policy A by policy B ?". There is a popular research topic that, to estimate performance metrics that can be expressed as expectations with respect to the distribution that would have been observed if the counterfactual conditions had been in force.
