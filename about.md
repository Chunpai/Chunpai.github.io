Welcome to my blog ! My name is Chunpai Wang, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at State University of New York at Albany. I am interested in structure prediction, reinforcement learning, and science fiction. I get used to write notes of my interested papers which typically contains some mathematic derivation in latex (overleaf). Also there are a lot interesting papers which exploit the empirical methodologies, and it would be useful to write a post to do a quick summary. This blog is a work in progress, please leave a comment if you have any question, and I look forward to seeing your any feedback as well. It is always good to share your ideas with others. Keep Simple and Meliora !   Â
