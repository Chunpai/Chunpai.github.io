Welcome to my blog ! My name is Chunpai Wang, and I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at State University of New York - Albany. I am interested in finding insights and patterns from data using math and statistics tools. I get used to write notes of my interested papers which typically contains some mathematic derivation in latex, and the blog post would be useful to write a quick summary. This blog is a work in progress, please leave a comment if you have any question, and I look forward to seeing your any feedback as well. It is always good to share your ideas with others. Keep Simple and Meliora !   Â
