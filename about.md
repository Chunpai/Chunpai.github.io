Welcome to my blog ! My name is Chunpai Wang, and I am a Ph.D. student in computer science at State University of New York at Albany. I get used to write notes of my intereted papers which typically contains some mathematic derivation in latex (overleaf). Also there are a lot interesting papers which are less math-intense, and I find that it would be useful to reproduce the proposed model of those papers, and write a post in a blog to keep track of the implementation procedures.  Each post here typically links with a github repository. This is a work in progress, and I look forward to seeing your feedback if find any mistake, and leave a comment if you find it is helpful to you. It is always good to share your ideas with others. Keep Simple and Meliora !   Â
