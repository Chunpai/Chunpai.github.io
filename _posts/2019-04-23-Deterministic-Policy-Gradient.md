In this post, I will summarize three papers related to the deep reinforcement learning in continuous action space, which are 

- [Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithms](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.pdf )
- [Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02971.pdf )
- [Continuous Deep Q-Learning with Model-based Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00748v1.pdf )



### Deterministic Policy Gradient 

You can see that the $$\nabla \bar{R}_{\theta}â€‹$$ derived before becomes 0 if it is deterministic policy.
