## Structured Prediction

`2019-06-24`

- ~~implement the structured SVM, and try to understand the algorithm and limitations~~
  - ~~cutting plane method to find the most violated constraints~~
  - ~~we only need to implement 3 procedures: 1) feature mapping 2) the loss function 3) maximization to find cutting plane~~ 
- ~~use PyStruct module rather than the SVM^{struct} API~~

- extend the PyStruct, and choose one model, learner, inference first. 
  - run examples in PyStruct first
  - We need to know how cutting plane algorithm works, and check which part of PyStruct using cutting plane
  - encode the connectivity constraints into the cutting plane method
  - check the examples of pystruct to do the multiclass svm on MNIST
- Try to understand the implementation of conditional random field, unary potential and pairwise potential
